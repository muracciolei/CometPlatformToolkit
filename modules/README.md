# CometPlatform Modules

## Overview

CometPlatform is a modular web development platform designed for AI agent automation, workflow orchestration, and collaborative development. Each module provides standalone functionality while seamlessly integrating through a unified architecture.

## Core Philosophy

**Agent-First Design:** All modules are optimized for programmatic access and automation by AI agents, with human-friendly interfaces as a secondary concern.

**Modularity:** Each component can function independently or as part of a larger workflow pipeline.

**Extensibility:** Plugin architecture allows custom capabilities without core modifications.

      "action": "request",
      "params": { "url": "...", "method": "GET" },
      "onSuccess": "process-data",
      "onError": "retry"
    },
    {
      "id": "process-data",
      "module": "code-editor",
      "action": "transform",
      "params": { "script": "..." },

**Plugin Manifest Structure:**
```json
{
  "name": "example-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capabilities": ["image-processing", "data-export"],
  "dependencies": ["file-manager@^2.0"],
  "permissions": ["fs:read", "network:external"],
  "entry": "plugin.js"
}
```

#### 8. Agent Memory System (Planned)
**Path:** `/modules/agent-memory/` (to be created)
**Status:** ðŸš§ Design phase
**Purpose:** Persistent context and knowledge management

**Storage Layers:**
- **Short-term:** Current session context (in-memory)
- **Working:** Recent interactions (IndexedDB)
- **Long-term:** Historical knowledge (cloud storage)

**Memory Types:**
- Episodic: Event sequences and action history
- Semantic: Facts, relationships, learned concepts
- Procedural: Successful workflow patterns

## Inter-Module Communication

### Event Bus Protocol

Modules communicate via a central event bus using a standardized message format:

```javascript
{
  "event": "module.action",
  "source": "api-tester",
  "target": "workflow-orchestrator",
  "payload": { /* action-specific data */ },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-28T23:18:00Z",
  "correlation_id": "uuid-v4"
}
```

### Module Registration

Each module registers its capabilities on initialization:

```javascript
// Example: API Tester registration
Platform.registerModule({
  name: 'api-tester',
  version: '1.2.0',
  capabilities: ['http.request', 'http.mock'],
  events: {
    listens: ['workflow.step', 'file.save'],
    emits: ['request.complete', 'error.network']
  }
});
```

## Development Guidelines

### Module Structure

Every module should follow this directory structure:

```
module-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ module-name.html    # UI interface
â”œâ”€â”€ module-name.js      # Core logic
â”œâ”€â”€ module-name.css     # Styling (optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Module documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/              # Unit and integration tests
â””â”€â”€ manifest.json       # Module metadata
```

### Module Lifecycle

1. **Initialize:** Module loads and registers with platform
2. **Ready:** Subscribes to relevant events
3. **Active:** Processes requests and emits events
4. **Cleanup:** Unsubscribes and releases resources

### Best Practices

**For Agent Integration:**
- Provide programmatic APIs alongside UI
- Return structured data (JSON) for machine parsing
- Include operation status and error details
- Support batch operations where applicable
- Document all public methods and events

**For Human Users:**
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Consistent visual language across modules
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Accessible design (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**For Performance:**
- Lazy-load module code
- Debounce expensive operations
- Use Web Workers for heavy computation
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Monitor memory usage

## Security Considerations

### Permission Model

Modules request permissions at initialization:

```javascript
const permissions = [
  'fs:read',        // Read file system
  'fs:write',       // Write to file system
  'network:same',   // Same-origin network requests
  'network:ext',    // External network requests
  'storage:local',  // Local storage access
  'exec:terminal'   // Terminal command execution
];
```

### Sandboxing

Plugins run in isolated contexts with controlled access to platform APIs.

### Audit Trail

All privileged operations are logged for security review.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
Test individual module functions in isolation.

### Integration Tests
Verify inter-module communication and workflow execution.

### Agent Tests
Simulate agent interactions to ensure programmatic access works correctly.

### Performance Tests
Benchmark critical paths and identify bottlenecks.

## Deployment

### Standalone Modules
Each module can be deployed independently as a web component.

### Platform Bundle
The full platform is served from `/public/index.html` with modules loaded on demand.

### Cloud Deployment
Supports serverless deployment with optional backend services for persistence and collaboration.
